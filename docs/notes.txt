## The use of  if __name__ == "name"

    So this is used jut to do correct import of files, so we do not have unxpected run of the files.
    Scenario: If we have a main.py file and we have functions that run on main.py file but also these functions 
    we need them to run on second.py file. Now if we import  the functions on second.py file the functions on main.py
    file will run automatically when we import them. So if we want to make sure that the functions of main.py do not run when we import main.py
    we need to run it on main.py using the check if __name__ == "main". 
    If for exmp: The main.py wouldnt have functions running but just declared functions, than importing wouldnt be a problem.
